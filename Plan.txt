When youâ€™re setting up **basic Google Cloud Platform (GCP) infrastructure**, you want the essential building blocks that nearly every environment
needs before you can deploy apps, workloads, or services. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the core components:

---

## 1. **Networking**

* **VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)** â€“ the backbone of your network where everything runs.
* **Subnets** â€“ carve up your VPC into smaller IP ranges (public / private).
* **Firewall Rules** â€“ control inbound/outbound traffic.
* **Cloud Router + Cloud NAT** â€“ allow private resources to access the internet without exposing them.

---

## 2. **Compute**

* **Compute Engine (VMs)** â€“ for virtual machines when you need raw compute.
* **Instance Groups (MIGs)** â€“ for autoscaling and high availability.
* (Optional) **Kubernetes (GKE)** â€“ if youâ€™re containerized.

---

## 3. **Storage**

* **Cloud Storage Buckets** â€“ object storage for files, logs, backups, static content.
* **Persistent Disks** â€“ block storage attached to VMs.
* (Optional) **Filestore** â€“ managed NFS for shared file systems.

---

## 4. **Identity & Access**

* **IAM (Identity and Access Management)** â€“ define who can do what.
* **Service Accounts** â€“ for workloads like VMs or apps.
* **Organization / Folders / Projects** â€“ basic resource hierarchy.

---

## 5. **Monitoring & Logging**

* **Cloud Logging** â€“ capture logs from VMs, networks, and services.
* **Cloud Monitoring (Stackdriver)** â€“ metrics, dashboards, and alerts.

---

## 6. **Security & Policies**

* **Encryption Keys (KMS)** â€“ manage sensitive data.
* **Security Command Center** (optional) â€“ security posture management.
* **VPC Service Controls** (optional) â€“ isolate sensitive services.

---

## 7. **Optional but Common**

* **Load Balancer** â€“ distribute traffic across instances.
* **DNS (Cloud DNS)** â€“ domain name resolution.
* **CDN (Cloud CDN)** â€“ faster content delivery globally.
* **Pub/Sub / Cloud Functions** â€“ event-driven apps.
* **BigQuery / Databases (Cloud SQL, Firestore, Spanner)** â€“ for data persistence.

---

ðŸ‘‰ In **Terraform**, the most *basic* setup youâ€™d want to start with is:

* VPC + Subnets + Firewall
* Cloud Router + Cloud NAT
* A Compute Instance (VM)
* A Storage Bucket (for logs/files)
* IAM roles / service accounts
* Logging & monitoring enabled
